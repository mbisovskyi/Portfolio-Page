  "A highly motivated software developer that loves to develop himself while developing an application! A foreigner that came to the U.S. with $500 in a pocket and no English. I was sure that I can overcome that tough path.";

const textTwo =
  "What was the goal? The goal was to change the life, and I did it in the most extremely way. I took a big risk when I went to a new country. I needed somehow to recommend myself.";

const textThree =
  "In two years I decided to become a truck driver. That was the only way to live a comfortable, financially independent life. I was doing it for 7+ years, but that wasn't a thing I always wanted to do. Being a truck driver is very bad for mental and physical health.";

const textFour =
  "Thank God I had my son born and something clicked in my head. I realized that I need to change my lifestyle and become a better father to my son, than just a truck driver that is wasting an opportunity to watch how his child is growing up.";

const textFive =
  "I wanted to change my life once again and implement my dream during that life-changing process. My dream was to work in the office as a software developer, a developer that helps to change the world. Finally, I'm another step closer to my dream!";
